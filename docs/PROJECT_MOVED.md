# ✅ Project Successfully Moved!

## New Location
**C:\Users\jmjav\camera_recorder\**

The project has been moved from `C:\Users\jmjav\cursor\` to avoid Python path issues.

## ✅ Setup Complete

- ✅ Virtual environment created (`.venv`)
- ✅ All packages installed:
  - opencv-python
  - numpy
  - mediapipe

## How to Use

### Navigate to the new location:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\jmjav\camera_recorder
```

### Activate virtual environment:
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Run scripts:

**Test cameras:**
```powershell
python test_cameras.py
```

**Run debug recorder (interactive):**
```powershell
python debug_recorder.py
```

**Run main recorder:**
```powershell
python dual_camera_recorder.py
```

## Quick Commands (without activating venv)

You can also use the full path to Python:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe debug_recorder.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_cameras.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe dual_camera_recorder.py
```

## Old Location

Your old files are still at: `C:\Users\jmjav\cursor\`

You can delete that folder after verifying everything works in the new location.

## Next Steps

1. Open a new terminal/PowerShell
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\jmjav\camera_recorder`
3. Run: `python test_cameras.py` to test your cameras
4. Run: `python debug_recorder.py` to debug any issues

The path error should now be resolved! 🎉
